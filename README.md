# discord_API
These files are examples of some Discord API apps I've written for myself. The code isn't meant to be replicated or deployed in production.




app.js -> Main entry point for message archival and message interation. Houses the interaction slash commands and the GPT3 prompt initiation. 

guessing_game.js -> A guessing game for friends to guess who liked the twitter media that the bot posts at random. Pulls from a database of tweet data I grab as a cron job every day as part of a different script.
